"Efficient Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) of Airlines Dataset: Streamlining Data Integration and Preparation for Enhanced Analysis"
Data Extraction: Begin by extracting the airline's dataset from the DataBricksFileSystem. This could involve accessing a database, retrieving files from a storage system, or using an API to fetch the data. 
Data Exploration and Understanding: Once the data is extracted, perform an initial exploration to understand its structure, format, and quality. Use Databricks' data exploration capabilities, such as Spark DataFrame operations, to gain insights into the dataset's schema, missing values, and statistical summaries.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Preprocess the dataset to clean and transform it into a usable format. Leverage Spark's DataFrame transformations and functions are available in Databricks to perform tasks efficiently.
Data Loading: Determine the target destination for the transformed data. It could be a database, a data warehouse, or a storage system. Configure the appropriate connection details and write the cleaned and transformed dataset to the target location using Spark DataFrame's write methods. Databricks provides integration with various data storage systems, making it easier to load data seamlessly. Finally transformed data was converted into a delta table and stored in the warehouse.
